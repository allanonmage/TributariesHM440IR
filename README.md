# TributariesHM440IR

Way back in the day, Crestron had an internal program where tech 
support people could write modules in exchange for credit to buy company
 merchandise.  I did a couple modules, and made some CresCash as it was 
called.


I won't post the code here on GitHub, but you can find it on the Crestron Applications market: https://applicationmarket.crestron.com/tributaries-cable-hm440ir-north-america/.
To my knowledge, there was no agreement to keep the fact that I made the module secret, so that's why I'm here talking about it.


Crestron modules are pretty much open source because of they nature 
of them, so you can see some code and documentation that i wrote over 
there.  If you know SIMPL, then you'll be at home with the files 
provided.  If you don't, you won't even have the software to look at the
 files, so you'll have to trust me when i say that I have published 
modules.


This repo is simply a placeholder in my portfolio.
